    "The purpose of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is fourfold. First, the raw Seoul Bike Sharing Demand dataset is examined to provide an overview of the data structure, the distribution of the target variable, and the presence of missing values or outliers. Second, the dataset is preprocessed and cleaned using the `clean_seoul_bike_data` pipeline to ensure consistency and reproducibility. Third, key relationships between explanatory variables and bike rental demand are explored to inform feature selection and modelling choices. Finally, the cleaned dataset is saved in a reproducible parquet format under `data/processed/` for subsequent modelling and evaluation."

However, the conditional distributions indicate that most non-zero precipitation values are relatively small, with only a limited number of extreme events. Including precipitation intensity directly as a continuous regressor may therefore contribute little additional explanatory power while introducing numerical instability and negative influence on models from these rare extreme observations. To address this, binary indicator variables are constructed to capture the occurrence of rainfall and snowfall, allowing the models to focus on the presence of precipitation as the primary signal.

    "The scatter plots reveal heterogeneous and largely non-linear relationships between continuous weather variables and hourly bike rental demand. Temperature and dew point temperature exhibit a clear positive association with demand, particularly at moderate to warm levels, although dispersion increases substantially at higher values. Humidity and wind speed show weaker and more diffuse relationships with demand. While high humidity and strong winds are generally associated with lower rental volumes, the relationship is highly dispersed and does not follow a simple linear pattern. Visibility displays a weak positive association with rentals, with higher demand occurring predominantly under clearer conditions; however, substantial variation remains across the full range of visibility values. Solar radiation exhibits a non-linear relationship, reflecting its strong interaction with time of day: demand is low when solar radiation is near zero (nighttime) and increases during daylight hours, but the marginal effect weakens at higher radiation levels.\n",

    "Rainfall and snowfall are characterised by pronounced zero inflation and sharp discontinuities. Demand drops markedly when precipitation occurs, even at low intensities, while further increases in precipitation intensity have comparatively limited additional effect. This pattern supports modelling precipitation primarily through occurrence indicators rather than relying solely on continuous intensity measures."

    "Following the analysis of continuous explanatory variables, the analysis turns to temporal variables that enter the dataset in categorical form, including month, hour, season, and day of week. These variables capture systematic temporal structures in bike rental demand, such as diurnal commuting cycles and seasonal usage patterns, which are not adequately summarised by simple correlation measures. Examining these temporal categories provides insight into how demand varies across different time segments and whether such variation is stable and economically meaningful."

    "To assess the relationship between temporal categorical variables and bike rental demand, the average hourly rental count is computed for each category of month, hour, season, and day of week. Plotting category-specific means allows differences in average demand across time segments to be visualised directly, offering an intuitive assessment of the magnitude and structure of temporal effects. This approach is suitable for categorical variables, such that it can support interpretationn of correlation coefficients."

    "The heatmap reveals several strong correlations among weather-related variables, most notably between temperature and dew point temperature, indicating substantial redundancy in their information content. In contrast, most temporal variables, such as hour and day of week, exhibit relatively weak correlations with weather features, suggesting that they capture distinct dimensions of demand variation. Binary precipitation indicators are, as expected, strongly correlated with their corresponding continuous measures, reflecting the construction of these variables. Overall, the heatmap highlights the presence of correlated feature groups while confirming that many explanatory variables provide complementary information for modelling."
